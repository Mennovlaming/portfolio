# portfolio
Portfolio sandbox, learning new things, retrieve GitHub API data and display it, this time with React.

## Introduction
Welcome to my (for now) portfolio website, 

For the minor Web Development we had to combine our skills from the last projects we had done (A CSS only firework show and an online art experience with API data), 
and make it to a somewhat dynamic portfolio that retrieves and displays Github data. 
I like to learn new things, so I wanted to use something I never did. With the last project I learned how to retrieve and filter API data and
how to change hash links and use that to display an item specific details page. So now I decided to do it all again, but this time with 
ReactJS, a Javascript framework I had no experience in.

### Start
To set up the files used for the project, I used Vite. Vite installs the latest version of the framework you want to use, and installs it with 
the packages you need and will be helpfull for the project (eg. auto reload on save, a small template, map structure).

## Components and props
I learned in some introduction videos that React works with combining components and so it's very dynamically,
I also learned about functional and class components and what to use, and that you can pass data between these components using 'props'.

## State hook
Next thing I looked into was using the State Hook, a react feature that lets you store data in a UseState variable which can be very usefull.

"The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application." 

## React Router 
Next thing I learned was about React Router, React uses React Router to navigate to different pages, while staying on the same page, so it swaps 
content on the same page, on this way your React project will stay a single page application while it functions like a multiple page application.

### Code
To see explanation about the code, see the files in de 'src' folder, I made a lot of comments of the stuff I learned

##disclaimer
the result is not the final product yet, but this was the best I could do in a small week of time.
